# Shopping List Application

This is a full-stack shopping list application built with **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js + Express** for the backend. The application allows users to manage a shopping list by adding, editing, viewing, and deleting items. The data is stored in a JSON file on the server.

---

## Features

- **Frontend:**
  - Add new shopping list items with a name and quantity.
  - View all items in a list with checkboxes.
  - Edit existing items.
  - Delete items.
  - View item details in a modal.
  - Responsive and professional UI built with **Bootstrap**.

- **Backend:**
  - REST API with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - Data stored in a JSON file (`shoppingList.json`).
  - Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **CORS**.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - Axios (for API calls)
  - Bootstrap (for styling)
  - React-Bootstrap (for pre-built components)

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - CORS (for cross-origin requests)
  - Body-parser (for parsing JSON data)
